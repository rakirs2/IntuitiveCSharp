# Setup

The student has a windows computer. We simply installed VS on the computer and are going to go from there.

## Git/Github

We're using github for all software. This will give the student version control/ability to post their own and retrieve their code from anywhere. 

Student must have their own Account to post to. They can make all of their repos private and share with teacher as needed.

## Hardware requirements

This is one of the few times that the computer might need to be a little stronger as it's [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com). That being said, we can revert to Rider/etc. later if it's not working
