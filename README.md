# IntuitiveCSharp

This is an attempt at teaching programming to an 8th grader. CSharp was chosen because it is general purpose and strictly typed. 
The Goals are to try teaching this student "in reverse" meaning giving all of the tools at the beginning (Visual Studio, Git etc) and
seeing if that's a better method writ large.


## Source Material

Almost all of my CSharp 'knowledge' will come from three sources

1. Richter's CLR Via C#
2. MS [Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us)
3. My [notes](https://github.com/microsoft/Flash_University/tree/main/CLR_via_CSharp) on CLR via C#

## How to go through this

These notes are going to assume 1 hour of "teaching time" with 1 project. I think a lot of it depends on student's current understanding of the computer. 
In this case, the student had a working understanding of powershell and cmd before our first session so it's probably ok to just see what happens.

I tend to focus on one topic, 1 set of problems per session. Unforutnately, that will make the sequencing kind of hard but that's ok.

Finally, I want to focus on fun and building shit. I am overcorrecting for probably a too difficult intro so we're going to be doing a lot of "confidence build up" projects.
